# Chirp Server

A Twitter Clone made based on a [@zanfranceschi challenge](https://dev.to/zanfranceschi/desafio-modelagem-de-bd-do-twitter-402b) to model the Twitter database with threads, recursive replies, retweets, etc

I expanded the concept to create the whole backend and not only the database for training purposes
